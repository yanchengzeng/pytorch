    This operator is supposed to be used only with torch.compile stack.
    There are two modes in this operator:

    Mode 1: WrapActivationCheckpoint
    This mode is used for selective checkpointing + torch.compile.
    Under this mode, we wrap torch.utils.checkpoint. This avoids
    TorchDynamo to look into saved tensor hooks and directly passes the control
    to AOT Autograd, which is ok with tracing saved tensor hooks. As a result of
    AOT tracing torch.utils.checkpoint code, particularly _CachingTorchDispatchMode
    and _CachedTorchDispatchMode, we obtain FX graph with added "recomputable" tag
    to the nodes that should be recomputed. Then, similar to TagActivationCheckpoint
    case, we rely on the partitioners to actually duplicate the nodes.

    Complexity with functionalization of rng ops: today, there are two different
    functionalization of rng ops - one at AOT autograd and other at Inductor.
    And they are difficult to map to each other. The rng states also complicate
    pattern matching in Inductor. Due to the ease of implementation, we are
    currently inclined towards functionalization at Inductor level, which means
    that duplication/recomputation is done as a compiler pass in the
    partitioners. See TagActivationCheckpoint for more information.

    Mode 2: TagActivationCheckpoint
    This mode is used for full activation checkpointing + torch.compile.
    Under this mode, the operator accepts a Fx graph module which needs to be checkpointed.
    This operator adds "recomputable" tag to the nodes of the Fx graph that
    should be recomputed.

    The goal is to avoid both Dynamo and AOT Autograd to trace through saved
    tensor hooks, and rather rely on the partitioners to actually duplicate the
    nodes. This sits well in the torch.compile stack, because by the time graph
    reaches partitioner, inductor has already run its functionalization of rng
    ops. Therefore, the duplication of nodes, by design, respects the rng states
    in the forward and recomputed forward in backward.

        checkpoint fn can have mixed kwargs between checkpointed fn and
